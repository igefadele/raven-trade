# RavenTrade

Trade App For RavenPay Crypto Market Trading. 

It's a functional app that you can use to monitor crypto pairs like BTCUSDT, etc. by following the candlestic charts and order books in realtime as retrieved from the Binance API.

### NOTE: 
- If you are running this project (this codebase) from a country where Binance is currently restricted in, then you will have to use a VPN to access the Binance WebSocket API to get the needed data used within the app.


## Tools, Packages
- GetX is used for state management, route management and dependency injection
- nb_utils is used for some UI utilities and extensions.
- ScreenUtils is adopted for dynamic sizing of UI elements.
- Dio is used for network calls.
- Binance Websocket API is the data source used in the app. 

## Credits
