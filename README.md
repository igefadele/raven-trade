##  Description

Trade App For RavenPay Crypto Market Trading. 

It's a functional app that you can use to monitor crypto pairs like BTCUSDT, etc. by following the candlestic charts and order books in realtime as retrieved from the Binance API.

You can easily build on this to create a full-fledged Crypto Trading App, as I've taken my time to lay the foundation needed for an enterprise-grade crypto trading app in this project.

- Routes Management: Set.
- Dependency Injection: Set.
- Modules, Repositories, Providers, Utils, Values, Themes, etc: All Structure Set.
- And many more...

### Note: 
- If you are running this project (this codebase) from a country where Binance is currently restricted, then you will have to use a VPN to access the Binance WebSocket API to get the needed data used within the app.


## Tools, Packages, & Dependencies
- GetX is used for state management, route management and dependency injection
- nb_utils is used for some UI utilities and extensions.
- ScreenUtils is adopted for dynamic sizing of UI elements.
- Dio is used for network calls.
- Binance Websocket API is the data source used in the app. 
- Candlesticks package is used to display the candlestciks charts in the app.


## Credits
- The UI Figma design for this project is supplied by the RavenPay team (Don't forget to give them a shout-out if you use this repo for your next project)
